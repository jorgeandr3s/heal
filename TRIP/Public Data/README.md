# Data Use Agreement for the Tips and Recommendations for the Ingestion of Psilocybin (TRIP) Survey
## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this agreement is to govern the use of data from the Tips and Recommendations for the Ingestion of Psilocybin Survey (TRIP Survey). Use of these data for any commercial or non-commercial purposes is permitted **only** under the terms outlined in this document.
This agreement also notifies the user that the dataset and associated documentation may be updated periodically through quality-improvement processes, regulatory or institutional mandates, or methodological refinements. Users are responsible for checking the following sources for updates:

<ul>
  <li> The active repository on GitHub: https://github.com/jorgeandr3s/heal/tree/main/TRIP/ </li> 
  <li> The HEAL Lab website: https://heal-lab.ca/ </li> 
</ul>

## 2. Ownership of the Data
The TRIP Survey and its data are the intellectual property of **The Healthy Ecologies and Lifestyles (HEAL) Lab** at **Simon Fraser University (SFU)**. All rights are reserved, including dissemination of findings, unless otherwise agreed upon with the HEAL Lab.
Any outputs (e.g., reports, manuscripts, presentations) produced from these data must identify the TRIP Survey and the HEAL Lab as their source, and an offer of authorship must be extended to the HEAL Lab’s Director, consistent with the requirements in Section 5.

## 3. Collaboration with the HEAL Lab on Analysis Plans
The Principal Investigator for the TRIP Survey is Dr. Kiffer Card, **Director of the HEAL Lab,** who serves as the scientific lead for decisions regarding data use (please direct all inquiries to (kcard@sfu.ca).
<ul>
  <li> Analysis plans that will lead to knowledge-exchange products or manuscripts must be shared with the HEAL Lab Director for review and consultation.</li> 
  <li> The data user must submit or discuss analysis plans for themselves and anyone they supervise.</li> 
  <li> Approval or consultation feedback should be received within two weeks of the request.</li> 
</ul>

## 4. Database Sharing and Conditions of Use
The TRIP Survey database is the property of the HEAL Lab. Shared use of the database is granted only under the following conditions:
<ul>
  <li> No results that could potentially identify a participant may be released, and no attempts to identify participants are permitted.</li> 
  <li> The data user must cease using the data and destroy all copies in their possession immediately upon request from the HEAL Lab Director.</li> 
  <li> Users must periodically check the GitHub repository and HEAL Lab website noted above for updated data dictionaries, codebooks, documentation, and corrected or enhanced datasets, as continuous quality-improvement processes may require amendments that supersede previous versions.</li> 
</ul>

## 5. Dissemination of Findings
<ol>
  <li> Any public-facing outputs (e.g., preprints, reports, manuscripts, media summaries, conference presentations) that arise from the TRIP Survey must be approved by the HEAL Lab Director before release.</li>
  <li> Findings must be provided to the HEAL Lab Director at least 5 business days prior to the planned publication or dissemination date.</li>
  <li> Plans for dissemination will be developed collaboratively with the HEAL Lab Director, and draft/final manuscripts or reports will be shared—including an invitation to co-authorship.</li>
  <li> Authorship must be determined in consultation with the HEAL Lab and follow the ICMJE guidelines referenced in the original agreement, including:
  <ul>
  <li> Substantial contributions to conception/design or data acquisition/analysis/interpretation; **AND** </li>
  <li> Drafting or critical revision for important intellectual content; **AND** </li>
  <li> Final approval of the version to be published; **AND** </li>
  <li> Substantial contributions to conception/design or data acquisition/analysis/interpretation; AND </li>

<ul>
  <li> Verify version numbers of datasets and documentation prior to conducting analysis;</li> 
  <li> Cite the version used in all publications;</li> 
  <li> Regularly check the GitHub repository and HEAL Lab website for updates or corrections.</li> 
</ul>

## 7. Agreement
