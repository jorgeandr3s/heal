"Welcome to the Tips and Recommendations for Ingesting Psilocybin Survey (TRIPS)!  This study is a national survey about psilocybin use that aims to help us develop guidelines to help people reduce harm and maximize the benefits of using psilocybin. It will also help us understand how changing norms, attitudes, and beliefs about psilocybin will influence uptake of guidelines. This survey is being conducted by Simon Fraser University.  *Please note that in this survey use of the word “psilocybin” refers to what is more commonly known as ‘magic mushrooms’ or simply, ‘mushrooms’*  The information below describes the risks and benefits of participating in this study, provides an overview of what your participation entails, and describes how your data will be stored.  Study Procedure We are asking you to answer a confidential questionnaire. The survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes if you have not consumed psilocybin before and 20-25 minutes if you have. You may skip questions that you do not wish to answer, or stop at any time. We will also ask you to participate in a follow-up visit in six months. We will ask for your email address to contact you at that time. Participation in both the current survey and the follow-up survey in six months is completely voluntary.  Rights and Compensation This study is completely voluntary. At the end of each survey you complete, you will be automatically directed to a form that will allow you to enter a prize draw for a $100 prize, payable via e-transfer. You must provide your email address to enter. If you do not make it to the end of the survey, you will not be able to enter.  Potential Risks Some of the questions we ask will cause you to reflect on your experiences using psilocybin and your personal opinions about psilocybin use and it’s regulation. We also ask questions about your demographic background. Some individuals may experience stress or discomfort while answering these questions – particularly if they have had a history of stressful or traumatic social encounters. You may skip questions that you do not wish to answer or you may take a short break at any point in the survey. If you no longer want to complete the survey, you can simply close the browser window or skip the remaining questions to reach the end of the survey in order to enter the prize drawing. A resource list for mental health resources will be provided at the end of the survey.  If you feel like you are experiencing distress check out the resources below to get help:   • Canadian Crisis Line: 833-456-4566  • First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness: 855-242-3310 . • Trans LifeLine: 877-330-6366  • BetterHelp Counselling Services: www.betterhelp.com  Potential Benefits There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this survey. By participating you are helping us develop guidelines and recommendations for lower risk psilocybin use.  Removal of Data If you decide to quit the survey before finishing it, we will not be able to remove your data. We are also not able to remove your responses even if you complete the survey.  Confidentiality Your participation is completely voluntary and confidential. No attempt will be made to identify you based on your survey responses. The data collected may be shared at a later date with other researchers with an interest in validating or findings or conducting additional analyses, but your participation will remain confidential. If you provide your email address to enter the prize draw, we will ask if we can retain your email address so that you can be invited to participate in a longitudinal component of the survey. If you agree, we will retain your email address until the study is completed and will create an anonymous ID that will allow us to link survey responses between this survey and potential follow-up surveys related to psilocybin use. If you do not express interest in participating in the longitudinal component of the survey, your email address will be deleted after the winners are selected for the prize draw. We will never share the email address you provide with anybody outside of our study team and no outside parties will know have access to identifiable information about our survey participants.  Data collection and storage This survey is hosted on the Qualtrics Survey platform. As such, your data will be temporarily stored at a Qualtrics data centre in Canada. Once the study has concluded, this data will be downloaded to secure servers at Simon Fraser University and deleted from the Qualtrics platform.  Data Availability Results from this study will be published in a public report located on our study website (https://getpsyched.ca/) and shared through academic journals and conferences. The data you provide will be kept by the Principal Investigators on secure servers at Simon Fraser University. A public version of the data set will also be made available 1 year after the results of this study are published to allow other researchers to validate our results and explore additional hypotheses. This public version will not include any personally identifying information. No additional informed consent will be collected for use of data from this publicly available data set.  Contact for information about the study If you have any questions or need further information with respect to this study, you may contact Dr. Kiffer Card at kcard@sfu.ca.  Contact for concerns about the rights of research subjects If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, you may contact the SFU Office of Research Ethics at dore@sfu.ca or 778-782-6593.
