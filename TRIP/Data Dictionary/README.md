This folder contains labels and descriptive data of the variables found in the dataset. 
Counts correspond to raw, unprocessed data and might not reflect those of the cleaned up version.
Please note that the SAS, SPSS, and Stata files contain modified labels (for variables and factor levels) to meet the requirements of these formats. The changes can be found in the corresponding file.
