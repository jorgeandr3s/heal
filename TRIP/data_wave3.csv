It helps dissociate at socially anxious social events like at a DJ show. I enjoy more being in a crowd or walking around an outdoor music festival. At smaller social events, a micro dose of psilocybin helps reduce the amount of alcohol consumed and saves money. A microdose makes one feel drunk and wobbly and makes the lazer lights and bright rave outfits really pop out and be interesting to look at.

Maybe that’s not the point, but a lot of these questions are WELL WEALTHY ABLED WELLNESS questions for elites that treat psilocybin as a cool new sweat lodge ayahausca fad. That is not how they are best used for people who actually need them to support their DISABLED WELLNESS. These two patterns are VERY distinct and the one your questions seem to prioritize are for the pattern of the former. The latter are the ones who need these studies to shift access, safety, and affordability to utilize psilocybin as a wellness tool in a complex regime of health management. I find this VERY concerning and not at all surprising. Hopefully you can divide this research into ACTUAL patients for whom this is a very useful tool, and the well wealthy and abled who use it as a way to go from already well and wealthy to more well and wealthier. I will not complete another survey for you if next year I find it is  again designed in a way that clearly deprioritizes patients for the privilege of the privileged.
